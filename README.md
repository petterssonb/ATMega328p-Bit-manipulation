## Microcontroller used

- [Amazon page](https://www.amazon.se/dp/B08B4D5MV5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)


## Purpose

 - This repository showcases a series of tasks that I have refined and improved since my first semester at Nackademin. It demonstrates my skills from simple LED operations to advanced timer register manipulation and overflow handling in microcontroller programming.

 ## Branches


 - The main branch contains basic examples of turning an LED on and off using bit manipulation, which was the initial task when we began working with microcontrollers.

 - The blinkFreqWithTimers branch includes a task where the frequency of an LED's blink rate is manipulated. The blink speed increases as more voltage is applied to the LED via a potentiometer, demonstrating dynamic control based on input voltage.

 - The userDefinedLedPower branch the LED's power is controlled by user input. Users input a number between 0-255; the LED turns on if the input is above 127 and off if it is lower, showcasing conditional logic and user interaction.

## Extension

I used PlatformIO in order to easily build and upload the code to the ATmega328 inside VScode.

For easy use download PlatformIO extension
