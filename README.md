# ATMega328p Bit Manipulation


## Purpose

 - This repository showcases a series of tasks that I have refined and improved since my first semester at Nackademin. It demonstrates my skills from simple LED operations to advanced timer register manipulation and overflow handling in microcontroller programming.

 ## Branches


 - The main branch contains basic examples of turning an LED on and off using bit manipulation, which was the initial task when we began working with microcontrollers.

 - The blinkFreqWithTimers branch includes a task where the frequency of an LED's blink rate is manipulated. The blink speed increases as more voltage is applied to the LED via a potentiometer, demonstrating dynamic control based on input voltage.

 - The userDefinedLedPower branch the LED's power is controlled by user input. Users input a number between 0-255; the LED turns on if the input is above 127 and off if it is lower, showcasing conditional logic and user interaction.
